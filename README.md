# Data Mid-Bootcamp Project Regression

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of a project dedicated to the prediction of house prices based on various features. It not only includes our objective but also the methods employed for data extraction and data wrangling. 

While this document is written with an audience in mind that may or may not have technical expertise with Python/SQL/Tableau, we've tried to make the information as accessible as possible.

## Project Goal
Our project goal is twofold:
1. Predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
2. Understand which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

## Data
Our dataset comprises of 22,000 properties within the timeframe of May 2014 to May 2015.

### Data Points
The dataset includes the following data points:
- id - Unique ID for each home sold
- date - Date of the home sale
- price - Price of each home sold
- bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms - Number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower
- sqft_living - Square footage of the apartments interior living space
- sqft_lot - Square footage of the land space
- floors - Number of floors
- waterfront - A dummy variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not
- view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was
- condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment
- grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.
- sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level
- sqft_basement - The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level
- yr_built - The year the house was initially built
- yr_renovated - The year of the houseâ€™s last renovation
- zipcode - What zipcode area the house is in
- lat - Lattitude
- long - Longitude
- sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
- sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors

### King County Grading System
Grades, as part of the King County grading system, represent the construction quality of improvements. They range from grade 1 to 13, and are generally defined as:

1. **1-3**: Falls short of minimum building standards. Normally cabin or inferior structure.
2. **4**: Generally older, low-quality construction. Does not meet code.
3. **5**: Low construction costs and workmanship. Small, simple design.
4. **6**: Lowest grade currently meeting building code. Low quality materials and simple designs.
5. **7**: Average grade of construction and design. Commonly seen in plats and older sub-divisions.
6. **8**: Just above average in construction and design. Usually better materials in both the exterior and interior finish work.
7. **9**: Better architectural design with extra interior and exterior design and quality.
8. **10**: Homes of this quality generally have high quality features. Finish work is better and more design quality is seen in the floor plans. Generally have a larger square footage.
9. **11**: Custom design and higher quality finish work with added amenities of solid woods, bathroom fixtures, and more luxurious options.
10. **12**: Custom design and excellent builders. All materials are of the highest quality and all conveniences are present.
11. **13**: Generally custom designed and built. Mansion level. Large amount of highest quality cabinet work, wood trim, marble, entry ways etc.
